.Sh DESCRIPTION

When ran with this configuration, reggae will first check if salt executable is
available, and if it isn't, it will run \fBpkg install -y py36-salt\fR inside
jail. Then it will mount playbook directory on /usr/local/etc/salt/states inside
jail. To do actual provisioning, Reggae uses \fBsalt-call --local state.apply\fR.
.Sh EXAMPLES

Quickest way to get basic service provisioned with salt is:
.Pp
.Dl mkdir myservice
.Dl cd myservice
.Dl reggae init salt
.Dl make
