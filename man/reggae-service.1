.SH NAME
reggae-service \- use a single jail to run set of processes

.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBservice.mk\fR

.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
Running make will invoke make up and if it is the first time you run it, make
provision will also be executed.

Supported make targets for service are:
 - destroy
 - devel
 - exec
 - export
 - login
 - provision
 - setup
 - up

Special note for \fBdevel\fR target: your repo must have \fBbin/dev.sh\fR which
devel will try to run. Also, devel will only work if you have
\fBDEVEL_MODE="YES"\fR in your vars.mk in service root. If you use it inside a
project, project's \fBDEVEL_MODE\fR will be propagated.

.SH EXAMPLES
Easiest way to configure a service is Makefile as following:

 SERVICE = myservice
 REGGAE_PATH = /usr/local/share/reggae

 .include <${REGGAE_PATH}/mk/service.mk>


.SH "ADDITIONAL INFORMATION"
See \fBreggae(1)\fR, \fBreggae-project(1)\fR and \fBreggae-ansible(1)\fR for
more info.
