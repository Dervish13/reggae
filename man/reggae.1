.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm reggae <command>
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Pp
\fBReggae\fR is an open source package which relays on \fBCBSD\fR to provide lower level management for jails and virtual machines.
.Pp
If you have ever used Vagrant or Docker Compose, Reggae is best described as an
alternative to those. It enables you easy development inside jail while code
editing is done on the host. It makes transition from development to production
easier by using provisioners. It makes host clean of all requirements of
development and puts them inside jail which is easily stopped, started,
provisioned, and destroyed.
.Pp
To initialize Reggae run the following as root:
.Pp
.Dl reggae network-init
.Dl # service pflog restart
.Dl # service pf restart
.Dl service sshd restart
.Dl reggae cbsd-init
.Dl reggae master-init
.Pp
PF is initialized only if /etc/pf.conf doesn't exist already. In those cases PF
services should be restarted.
.Pp
Through config file in /usr/local/etc/reggae.conf you can change values for
anything Reggae is using. \fBreggae network-init\fR will make sure sshd is
listening to lo0 on hosts with dynamic IP, and on lo0 and egress if the IP is
static.  This way host sshd doesn't have a conflict with the jailed one. Also,
if IP is dynamic, PF will be configured so it redirects all requests for SSH on
egress to lo0. One of the advantages is that you can use ssh's
\fBProxyCommand\fR to login to jail, even though jail is behind NAT.
.Pp
Ater \fBreggae master-init\fR, you'll get two master jails: DHCP and DNS. They
are used to lease IPs to virtual machines and to register all resources in DNS
so that you can use FQDN instead of IP addresses. The DNS jail IP is used in
/etc/resolvconf.conf if host has dynamic IP on egress, so that changes of
network parameters are passed to the appropriate jail. Also, host will use DNS
jail IP in /etc/resolv.conf. In short, it enables you to not remember jail IPs
when you have to use them, but use <jail name>.<domain> to reference them, in
which case comes from /usr/local/etc/reggae.conf.
